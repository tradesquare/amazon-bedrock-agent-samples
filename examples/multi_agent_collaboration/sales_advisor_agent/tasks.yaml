final_report_output_task:
  description: >
    The team has gathered and processed financial and external data. 
    Your task is to produce a polished final report that provides a comprehensive analysis 
    of the company's financial situation, considering both internal metrics and external influences.
    Provide all agent store keys for the project (including financial data, external data, and project details) 
    to the Formatted Financial Report Writer, and have them generate a formatted final report. 
    The Formatted Financial Report Writer is an expert at financial analysis and report generation.
    To ensure efficiency, divide the report into multiple sections, with the writer creating 
    individual parts that can be assembled later. These sections should be independent and 
    can be written in parallel. Prefix each section key with 'section_' (e.g., 'section_financial_overview').
    As a final step, instruct the Formatted Financial Report Writer 
    to retrieve a fresh copy of the markdown for each section from the agent store.
    With all the full text freshly retrieved, concatenate the sections in the correct order,
    and save the FULL and complete text (not just placeholders) to the agent store with 
    key 'complete_final_report'.
  expected_output: >
    A well-structured and formatted financial report saved in the agent store, along with the keys 
    for each of its sections, and the key for the complete final report. 
    The complete final report should be a concatenation of the FULL TEXT of all sections in the correct order,
    providing a holistic view of the company's financial health and external influences.
